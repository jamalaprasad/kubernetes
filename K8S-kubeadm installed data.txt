Your Kubernetes control-plane has initialized successfully!

To start using your cluster, you need to run the following as a regular user:

  mkdir -p $HOME/.kube
  sudo cp -i /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config
  sudo chown $(id -u):$(id -g) $HOME/.kube/config

Alternatively, if you are the root user, you can run:

  export KUBECONFIG=/etc/kubernetes/admin.conf

You should now deploy a pod network to the cluster.
Run "kubectl apply -f [podnetwork].yaml" with one of the options listed at:
  https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/addons/

Then you can join any number of worker nodes by running the following on each as root:

kubeadm join 172.31.33.202:6443 --token i61kqy.h53viqtxufg97dpg \
        --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:2d8d5bd7a311b1cb99c13611bc97ad8220aaab37bf1aee6f2bb5a3acc623c7c9

3. print the join token
      kubeadm token create --print-join-command
4. kubectl get nodes   
kubectl cluster info
sudo systemctl  restart kubelet.service
